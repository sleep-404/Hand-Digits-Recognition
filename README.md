## Deep Learning with TensorFlow

With this Software, you can use (or re-train) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting your own written Digits in a PyQT5 GUI.

## Requirements:
  * Anaconda with Python 3.5+ [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
  * Tensorflow 1.5+ for Python [Installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
  * PyQT5, Keras, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib for Python

## Usage:
  * Run ```python python drawing_gui.py ``` in the GUI folder. 
  * Before make sure that there are saved weights for the neural network. (/neural network/weights/)
